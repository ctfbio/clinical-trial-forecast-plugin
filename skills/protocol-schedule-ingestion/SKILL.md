description: Turn protocol schedule pages into a reviewable study-design changeset, resolving footnotes, arm differences, windows and uncertain marks before any apply.
---

The customer's own session reads the protocol. The connector receives only the selected structured planning fields; it neither reads uploads nor runs a model. Begin with `ctf_list_capabilities`, confirm environment and design write access, and identify the configuration with `ctf_list_studies` and `ctf_list_scenario_configurations`.

For a long PDF in Claude Code, locate the schedule from the contents and use page ranges, at most 20 pages per Read call; ranges are required beyond 10 pages. On claude.ai, ask for the schedule pages when the full protocol is too long. Look for Schedule of Activities, Assessments or Events, Study Flow Chart, appendices, continuation pages and separate arm/period schedules.

Extract a grid with page citations: visit, day and window headers; activity rows; encounter marks; arm and epoch. Retain page + short quote for each ambiguous interpretation. Map USDM 4.0.0 Encounter contact modes/settings to visit_type; an out-of-chain encounter to unscheduled; Timing windowLower/Upper to windows; arm-specific timelines to arm_keys; Condition text to conditional and condition_note. Probability needs a cited sentence or an explicit user assumption. Preserve printed codes only, with code_provenance=protocol. Read `ctf_list_reference_data` and `ctf_list_activities` before choosing vocabulary or reusing an activity.

Pause for unresolved footnotes, (X), X*, C, PRN, “if clinically indicated”, merged cells, missing/event-relative windows, conflicting headers, duplicate visits, parent/child activities, unbounded repeats, early-termination or unscheduled columns, arm-specific marks, amendment/SAP conflicts, hourly PK sub-grids, low-confidence OCR and scales without a printed code. Show the evidence and ask for the specific interpretation. Never turn an uncertain mark into a guessed frequency.

Read `ctf_get_study_design` and reconcile marks per arm before preparing visits, schedule entries and activities in `ctf_preview_changeset`. Show the diff and affected plans; ask for the user's change reason only after the preview. Apply the returned changeset and minted key with `ctf_apply_changeset`, then verify via `ctf_get_change` and `ctf_get_study_design`. Give the returned app_url. If approval is pending, follow the supplied web review link; this workflow has no approve tool. The web extraction flow reaches the same design objects; this workflow does not depend on protocol custody or version-acceptance tools. The preview's `risk` names the apply tool: tier 2 goes to `ctf_apply_changeset`; tier 3 (a protected, locked or several plans, an archive, an organization catalog, a decision, a rollback or more than 50 items) goes only to `ctf_apply_high_impact_changeset` with the preview's `confirmation_code`, after the user agrees.

## Links to the web application

Results carry `app_url` values. Each one opens a page of Clinical Trial Forecast for a person signed in to the organization this connection belongs to: a record's `app_url` shows that record, and a result's top-level `app_url` shows the whole result, or the nearest page when the web application has no view of it. `null` means there is no page.

- After answering, give an **Open in CTFBio** link from the returned app_url so the person can open the same data. Label each link with what its page shows, from the table below, for example: Open the cumulative spend chart for ASCEND-1 (Budget and Latest Estimate).
- When the page is only the nearest one (readiness, enrollment), say so, for example: Open ASCEND-1's budget overview.
- Give at most five record links. For more records, give the result's top-level `app_url` instead. For a comparison, a curve, a schedule or a readiness answer, give the top-level `app_url`.
- A budget comparison link opens Budgets › Compare with up to eight returned scenarios preselected; the spend overlay shows up to 3.
- In a terminal (Claude Code), write the full https:// address as plain text, never in backticks or a code block. Elsewhere a markdown link is fine.
- Use returned `view_links` for related screens: whiteboard, schedule-costs (cost and quantity), vendors, systems and team. Label these Open in CTFBio followed by the view name. Keep the returned org context and query parameters intact.
- Use only `app_url` values from results. Never build or edit a link.
- If the page says the link belongs to a workspace the account is not a member of, the person is signed in to the web application with a different account than the one connected here.
- When the person asks for a chart, you may draw one from the result's series, and also give the `app_url` of the maintained view.

### Current legal notice

If access is refused because the current legal notice needs acceptance, stop the workflow and give the person the web link supplied in the refusal. They must review and explicitly accept the notice themselves. Do not accept for them or retry protected operations until they have done so. After acceptance, retry the request; an existing connection can continue, with reconnection needed only if sign-in expired or the client requires it. If verification is unavailable, report that access remains blocked and retry later.
