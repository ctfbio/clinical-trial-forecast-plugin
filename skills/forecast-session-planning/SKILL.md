description: Plan a forecasting session from current organization data, forecast gaps and selected study cost dimensions.
---

1. Ask what decision the session should support and which study or scenario is in scope when this is not already clear.
2. Use `ctf_get_tenant_data_state` to establish which supported planning areas contain data. Returned census counts describe their stated scope; do not replace them with the length of a paginated list.
3. Use `ctf_get_forecast_gaps`. It covers the whole organization and has no study filter, so group by scenario configuration and keep the groups of the selected study or scenario. Group missing inputs, invalid relationships and stale calculations into actionable tasks.
4. Order the tasks by actual prerequisites: parent records before dependent records, assumptions before recalculation, and verified results before comparison.
5. Use `ctf_compare_study_scenarios` when a cost breakdown helps prioritize the user's question. Preserve signs, currencies, date ranges and incomplete-result flags.
6. Present the planned changes and available next operations. Perform changes only within the user's request and reread the affected state afterwards.

Report which gaps were resolved, which remain, and which require unavailable functionality or an account action. Account purchases, subscription changes and access administration happen through the application's supported user interface, not this workflow.

## Tools and connection scope

This workflow spans two area scopes: `ctf.planning`, which a connection starts with, and `ctf.forecasts`, which is opt-in — a client asks for it by name and the person checks its box at consent. Read access is enough for all three tools.

State today: every tool below is implemented. This workflow is offered only where the connector serves every one of them.

| Tool                          | Area scope      | Access | State today |
| ----------------------------- | --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| `ctf_get_tenant_data_state`   | `ctf.planning`  | read   | Implemented |
| `ctf_get_forecast_gaps`       | `ctf.planning`  | read   | Implemented |
| `ctf_compare_study_scenarios` | `ctf.forecasts` | read   | Implemented |

## Links to the web application

Results carry `app_url` values. Each one opens a page of Clinical Trial Forecast for a person signed in to the organization this connection belongs to: a record's `app_url` shows that record, and a result's top-level `app_url` shows the whole result, or the nearest page when the web application has no view of it. `null` means there is no page.

- After answering, give an **Open in CTFBio** link from the returned app_url so the person can open the same data. Label each link with what its page shows, from the table below, for example: Open the cumulative spend chart for ASCEND-1 (Budget and Latest Estimate).
- When the page is only the nearest one (readiness, enrollment), say so, for example: Open ASCEND-1's budget overview.
- Give at most five record links. For more records, give the result's top-level `app_url` instead. For a comparison, a curve, a schedule or a readiness answer, give the top-level `app_url`.
- A budget comparison link opens Budgets › Compare with up to eight returned scenarios preselected; the spend overlay shows up to 3.
- In a terminal (Claude Code), write the full https:// address as plain text, never in backticks or a code block. Elsewhere a markdown link is fine.
- Use returned `view_links` for related screens: whiteboard, schedule-costs (cost and quantity), vendors, systems and team. Label these Open in CTFBio followed by the view name. Keep the returned org context and query parameters intact.
- Use only `app_url` values from results. Never build or edit a link.
- If the page says the link belongs to a workspace the account is not a member of, the person is signed in to the web application with a different account than the one connected here.
- When the person asks for a chart, you may draw one from the result's series, and also give the `app_url` of the maintained view.

### Current legal notice

If access is refused because the current legal notice needs acceptance, stop the workflow and give the person the web link supplied in the refusal. They must review and explicitly accept the notice themselves. Do not accept for them or retry protected operations until they have done so. After acceptance, retry the request; an existing connection can continue, with reconnection needed only if sign-in expired or the client requires it. If verification is unavailable, report that access remains blocked and retry later.
