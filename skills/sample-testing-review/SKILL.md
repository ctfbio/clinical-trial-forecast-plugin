description: Review a scenario configuration's sample testing policies, month-by-month testing schedule and consent coverage of planned sample uses in Clinical Trial Forecast, using reads only.
---

Use this workflow for questions about how a study's samples are tested and whether each planned use is covered by consent. It reads stored records and projections; it changes nothing.

1. Resolve the scenario configuration. `ctf_get_study` with `detail_level: "standard"` lists one study's configurations; `ctf_list_scenario_configurations` lists them across the organization or for a `study_id`.
2. `ctf_list_scenario_testing_policies` returns the configuration's testing policies: the tested activity, the testing mode, kit, laboratory and declared monthly ceiling, with each policy's version.
3. `ctf_get_sample_testing_schedule` returns the stored month-by-month projection with its totals, capacity warnings, data cuts and the activities that have no usable policy. `from_month` and `to_month` take the first day of a month and narrow the page and the warnings, not the totals.
4. `ctf_check_intended_use_coverage` returns one verdict per planned sample use (`covered`, `not_offered`, `template_missing` or `unknown`) and counts over every planned use; only positive consent-template evidence reads `covered`. `ctf_get_scenario_design_layer` shows the intended uses themselves, alongside the configuration's endpoints and interim analyses.
5. Report capacity warnings, activities without a policy and uses that are not covered as specific findings, with the configuration's `app_url`. Treat `unknown` as unverified rather than covered.

Keep participant identifiers and any individual's data out of this workflow. Changing policies, consent templates or intended uses happens in the web application, or with the write workflows on a connection granted write access.

## Tools and connection scope

This workflow reads from two areas a connection starts with: `ctf.studies` and `ctf.scenarios`. Read access is enough for every tool.

State today: every tool below is implemented and served, read only, by the staging connector.

| Tool                                 | Area scope      | Access |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------- | ------ |
| `ctf_get_study`                      | `ctf.studies`   | read   |
| `ctf_list_scenario_configurations`   | `ctf.scenarios` | read   |
| `ctf_list_scenario_testing_policies` | `ctf.scenarios` | read   |
| `ctf_get_sample_testing_schedule`    | `ctf.scenarios` | read   |
| `ctf_check_intended_use_coverage`    | `ctf.scenarios` | read   |
| `ctf_get_scenario_design_layer`      | `ctf.scenarios` | read   |

## Links to the web application

Results carry `app_url` values. Each one opens a page of Clinical Trial Forecast for a person signed in to the organization this connection belongs to: a record's `app_url` shows that record, and a result's top-level `app_url` shows the whole result, or the nearest page when the web application has no view of it. `null` means there is no page.

- After answering, give links from those values so the person can open the same data in Clinical Trial Forecast. Label each link with what its page shows, from the table below, for example: Open the cumulative spend chart for ASCEND-1 (Budget and Latest Estimate).
- When the page is only the nearest one (readiness, enrollment), say so, for example: Open ASCEND-1's budget overview.
- Give at most five record links. For more records, give the result's top-level `app_url` instead. For a comparison, a curve, a schedule or a readiness answer, give the top-level `app_url`.
- A comparison link overlays the first 3 compared scenarios; say so when more were compared.
- In a terminal (Claude Code), write the full https:// address as plain text, never in backticks or a code block. Elsewhere a markdown link is fine.
- Use only `app_url` values from results. Never build or edit a link.
- If the page says the link belongs to a workspace the account is not a member of, the person is signed in to the web application with a different account than the one connected here.
- When the person asks for a chart, you may draw one from the result's series, and also give the `app_url` of the maintained view.
